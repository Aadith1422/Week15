# Lab: Snort as an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS)

## 1. Project Overview

This project documents the configuration and testing of Snort in **Intrusion Prevention System (IPS)** mode. Building upon the foundation of the IDS lab, this exercise demonstrates how to elevate Snort from a passive monitoring tool to an active network defense mechanism.

The primary objective is to reconfigure the system to not only detect but also **actively block** unwanted network traffic in real-time. This showcases the core functionality of an IPS as an enforcement point in a network security architecture.

## 2. Lab Environment

The same virtualized environment was used for consistency.

* **Snort Sensor:**
    * **Hostname:** `vboxuser@linux22`
    * **IP Address:** `19_2.168.56.131`
    * **Role:** The inline security device running the Snort IPS engine.

* **Testing Machine:**
    * **Hostname:** `aadith@aadith-LOQ-15IAX9`
    * **IP Address:** `192.168.56.101`
    * **Role:** The machine used to generate traffic to test the IPS.

## 3. IPS Configuration

The transition from IDS to IPS required two critical changes to the system's configuration.

### 3.1. Rule Modification: From `alert` to `drop`

The first step was to change the action in the custom rule located at `/etc/snort/rules/local.rules`. The `alert` keyword was replaced with `drop`. This simple change fundamentally alters the rule's behavior from passive logging to active blocking.

![Figure 1: Snort rule modified to use 'drop' action](./Screenshots/21.png)
*Figure 1: The rule in `local.rules` is updated with the `drop` action to block ICMP traffic.*

### 3.2. Traffic Redirection with `iptables`

For Snort to physically block packets, it must be placed "inline" to inspect traffic before it reaches its destination. This was achieved using `iptables` to create a firewall rule that intercepts all incoming ICMP traffic and redirects it to a Netfilter queue (`NFQUEUE`) for Snort to process.

```bash
sudo iptables -I INPUT -p icmp -j NFQUEUE --queue-num 0

```

## 4. Execution and Verification

Snort was launched in **inline mode**, configured to listen to the **Netfilter queue (nfq)** where **iptables** was sending the traffic.

###  Command Used

```bash
sudo snort -c /etc/snort/snort.conf -Q --daq nfq -A console
```

###  Verification Test
A final **ping test** was initiated. The results provide definitive proof of a **successful IPS deployment**:

- **Traffic was Blocked:**  
  The ping command from the testing machine failed completely, showing **100% packet loss**.

- **Prevention was Confirmed:**  
  The Snort console logged a **"DROPPED"** message for each packet, confirming it was the active component **blocking the communication**.

## 5. Conclusion

This lab successfully demonstrated the **configuration and operation of Snort** as an **Intrusion Prevention System (IPS)**.

By modifying the rule action to `drop` and placing the sensor inline with `iptables`, Snort was effectively transformed from a **passive observer** into an **active network defense**.

 **Result:**  
Snort not only provides **visibility into malicious traffic**, but can also **enforce security policies** by actively **preventing unwanted communication**.
