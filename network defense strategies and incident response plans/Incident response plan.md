# Incident Response Plan (IRP)

This document provides a formal, structured guide for responding to and managing cybersecurity incidents. The goal is to minimize damage, ensure a swift recovery, and learn from every event to strengthen our security posture.

The plan is divided into four distinct phases, forming a continuous cycle of improvement.

---

## Phase 1: Preparation üõ†Ô∏è

This proactive phase involves establishing the necessary resources, processes, and capabilities *before* an incident occurs. Proper preparation is the foundation of an effective response.

* **Develop a Plan:** Create and maintain this formal IRP, ensuring it is approved by management and accessible to all relevant personnel.
* **Form a Team:** Establish a dedicated **CSIRT** (Computer Security Incident Response Team) with clearly defined roles and responsibilities, including technical, legal, and communications members. Maintain an updated 24/7 contact list.
* **Assemble a Toolkit:** Deploy and maintain a set of security tools, including a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system, Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) solutions, and a forensic analysis "jump kit."
* **Train and Drill:** Regularly test the plan's effectiveness and build team readiness through tabletop exercises and realistic attack simulations.

## Phase 2: Detection & Analysis (Identification) üîç

This phase begins when a potential security event is suspected. The primary goals are to confirm if it is a real incident and to understand its scope.

* **Detect:** Identify potential incidents through various channels, such as automated alerts from security tools (SIEM, IDS/IPS, EDR), user-reported suspicious activity, or manual log analysis.
* **Analyze:** Investigate the initial alerts to determine their validity and avoid acting on false positives. Correlate data from multiple sources to build a clear picture of the event.
* **Scope & Prioritize:** Determine the extent of the breach (e.g., which systems are affected, what data is at risk) and assess its potential business impact to assign a severity level.
* **Document:** Immediately begin a detailed chronological log of all findings, actions taken, and communications. This documentation is critical for analysis and legal purposes.

## Phase 3: Containment, Eradication, & Recovery üõ°Ô∏è

This is the active response phase focused on damage control and returning to normal business operations. It consists of three sequential steps.

### Containment
The immediate priority is to stop the incident from spreading and prevent further damage. Actions include:
* Isolating affected systems from the network.
* Blocking malicious IP addresses at the firewall.
* Disabling compromised user accounts.

### Eradication
The goal is to completely remove the threat and its **root cause** from the environment. Actions include:
* Identifying and patching the vulnerability that allowed initial access.
* Removing all malicious files, backdoors, and unauthorized accounts.
* Completely wiping and rebuilding critical systems from trusted sources (**"nuke and pave"**) to ensure the threat is gone.

### Recovery
This step involves safely returning affected systems to production. Actions include:
* Restoring data from verified clean backups.
* Strategically bringing systems back online, starting with the most critical.
* Intensively monitoring the recovered systems for any signs of residual malicious activity.

## Phase 4: Post-Incident Activity (Lessons Learned) üìù

This final phase focuses on learning from the incident to improve future defenses and response efforts.

* **Post-Mortem Meeting:** Conduct a "blameless" review meeting with the CSIRT and stakeholders to analyze what happened, what went well, and what could be improved.
* **Final Report:** Create a comprehensive incident report detailing the timeline, root cause, scope of the damage, and key takeaways from the review.
* **Track Improvements:** Convert the lessons learned into a list of specific, actionable tasks. Assign each task to an owner with a deadline to ensure that security gaps are closed and the plan is updated.
